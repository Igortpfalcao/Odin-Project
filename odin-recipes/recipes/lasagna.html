        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet italian sausage</li>
            <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</l1>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 cans tomato paste</l1>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
